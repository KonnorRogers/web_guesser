# What is this

<p> This is a simple number guessing game to familiarize myself with sinatra. </p>

# Prerequisites
<p> Ruby must be installed, most likely only compatible w/ Ruby 1.9 and above due to hash syntax </p>
<p> You must have the following gems installed: </p>
<p> sinatra, sinatra-contrib </p>
<p> To install type: </p>       

    gem install sinatra

    gem install sinatra-contrib

<p> Alternatively: </p>

    gem install bundler

    bundle install

# Usage 
<p> To use, simply navigate to the directory </p>

    cd /path/to/web_guesser
    ruby web_guesser.rb
<p> This will then listen in on port 4657 </p>
<p> In a web browser, type localhost:4657 </p>
<p> This will bring up the very simple html game </p>

# Other

<p> Added config.ru for possible heroku deployment </p>
